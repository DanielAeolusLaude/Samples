Initially intended for Hydrogen (I've recorded multiple dynamic levels).
 
Captured with Zoom H2 at 96 kHz / 24-bit.
 
1. Edited with Audacity. No processing applied to the sliced samples apart from
some fix clipping (more in point 3 below). No compression, reverb, EQ of other
signal processing.
See the Audacity project pending.aup for sounds that are waiting for editing.
 
2. My approach with editing was to by any means necassary preserve absolutely
all of the natural fadouts of the sounds, no matter how much data it'd be.
So I used my ears and the Audacity's signal level meter to make sure the tails
of the hits are all already gone, before I cut. I also left a few seconds
of silence just to be sure.
2.1. The sounds can be shortened or faded with software that plays the samples
(Hydrogen, LMMS, an SF2 player etc.) - and I wanted to get as realistic and
beliveable sounds as possible.
2.2. Also keeping them as raw and unprocessed
as possible is a way to leave maximum flexibility to the artists. Once you add
reverb to a snare hit, there's no undo. So let the artists add this stuff
and please keep the processing (I mean compression and limiting too) to absolute
minimum. The dryer, the better. It has to be raw meat. So you can make anything
with it, not being limited by the salt someone added, that you can't get rid
of now without poking holes in your steak. Raw and unlimited. Also please keep
the samples in 24-bit. No dynamic processing means they maintain maximum dynamic
range. The Zoom H2 is not the quietest of linear PCM recorders, but at "Lo" gain
it's pretty nice. Let's not break this. Don't normalize, don't limit, don't
compress. Let the artist do that. I hate samples that are already mixed,
compressed, with fake reverb etc. Unless it's exactly what you're "selling",
the customer wouldn't want to see he's so limited with the samples. he got.
Of cource a lot of (young and learning) artists will not use any processing.
Doesn't matter. They'll learn what they can do and they'll appreciate the dry
material with untruncated natural fadeouts. Because this is what sounds good.
 
3. The original material had a lot of distorted samples. Some of the samples
I edited (the loudest ones) are distorted. The reason is limited SPL
of Zoom H2's built-in X-Y mics. They couldn't take the pressure. I had to throw
that out. Most o it was completely useless. Some stuff can still be saved
though. I tried to fix the clipping with Audacity's "Repair" function
or by truncating the atack (the first, distorted part of the transient was
deleted so the rest sounds well). Some of these samples need repair or else
should not be released with LMMS for production. I wouldn't want to get clipped
samples from Addictive Drums and I wouldn't want LMMS to ship such stuff.
We've had some pretty bad samples already, no need to have any more of them.
It's easy to make a mistake, but it's hard to make people forget about it and
trust you again.

4. Some kick samples have issuese with bass stereo phase corelation. This should
be fixed, but I haven't found a plugin that could monofonize a specific 
frequency band of the signal (<100 Hz for example). Maybe the Calf gyus could
help? They're pretty good with the mutiband-stuff. Altough it might drastically
alter the EQ balance of the samples, so be careful. It's a very tricky thing
to do. It might require some maual work with filters and mixing and good pair of
ears.

5. The toms suck. Better throw them out. I think it's better to give less but
top quality samples, than to mix the good stuff with some total crap.
Let's not do that.

6. I used the Audacity's "Label Track" functionality to export multiple files
at once. I advise you to learn this if you haven't already. It'll save a lot
of your precious time.

7. As said in the header, I release this material to public domain. I'd like the
opensource music world to benefit from this work, without any limitations.
I'm short on time and LMMS 1.1 is coming up, so maybe someone in the LMMS
developing community has the time and the will to finish this project and make
LMMS a better DAW for all of the mankind. Or something in a similar fashion.

8. I releas this in the context of LMMS, but there are no restrictions to use
the samples elsewhere. You can make an SF2 soundfont or Hydrogen drumkit.
Or make an opensource raspberry-pi drum machine that you'll sell on eBay.
Just keep it free and top quality at all times.
