Welcome to the LMMS samples repository. Here you can commit your own samples for review by the managers for inclusion in either the library or as a separate pack.

### Commit Rules:

1. The samples you commit must be [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). We can however give you credit (your name and email) in the about area of LMMS if you please.

2. These samples have to be created/recorded by you. They can not be taken from any other sample pack or library. The only exception to this rule is if you have a valid way to prove they are CC0.

### Definitions:
`Sample Packs:` These resource packs will be available for download on the LMMS website, once finished. ~~(http://lmms.io/download/samples)~~ (page inactive atm)

`Sample Library:` These samples are included in the default installation of LMMS. 

#### Which one should I choose?
If you have a large amount of samples, you will be better off commiting them as a Sample Pack. The Library's purpose is to have a small set of good quality samples to get users started.
